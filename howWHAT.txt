data engg in 2 layers (in folder straucture ) of staging,datawarehouse (to make dimension tbales),datamart layer .
i have to make fact and dimension tables. suggest what to do in each layer according to the data
this is the naming scheme i will be using , given your structure. give me code how can i do to get this transformed_users.csv. 
in my opinion,lets create the userskillproficiency, courseskill,designationskill normalised tables in the dimension layer. it will be an added step to be able to show
define hierarchy in designations.

do this for fact_course_progress.csv :
completion rate: everage number of days users havve taken to go from 0 to a 100percent completed on a course

progress_df['at_risk'] = (progress_df['percentage_completed'] < 50).astype(int)  # Flag users with less than 50% progress when the date of course assigned (first entry of that user with that course in progress table) has exceeded 15days



total courses completed per user,



for reporting and shit:
#average_duration_by_proficiency = courses_df.groupby('proficiency_level')['duration'].mean().reset_index()


#fact_course : avg rate of which users are completing this course. 
             : completed by all users (no user has this course active)

#fact user:total courses completed per user



also, according to this write a python scipt to define set of skills  needed by designations in a designations_skill.csv. and save it in the raw folder id,name
